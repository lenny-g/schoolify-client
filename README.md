## Summary

A app that brings parents closer to their childrenâ€™s school day.

Endless benefits for all parties involved. Business entities have moved their modeling process and communications online. Then why are schools (education centers) still so outdated with their approach?

This app works towards cutting green emissions, by reducing paper communication, and streamlining conversations between teachers and parents, this app also documents conversations and progress of children for future reference as a smart way of tracking progress.

A responsive dynamic app which will run in the browser. Schoolify is an easy to use application, which holds a Mongo database, and manages relations between parents, students and teachers. The website requires direct input from the user, where the user signs up and is easily able to navigate through the site. Teachers have different functionalities to what parents can do, through controlled routing.

## User Story

```
AS a user I expect to FIND a main page that gives me an overview of what the app is about.

I would ALSO expect to find some form of navigation on using the app, such as 'signing up' and 'logging in' buttons,

WHEN i click on either buttons, i EXPECT to be taken to a page where i can either login and be relocated to a private page or enter my details and sign up for instant use.

As a PARENT i would THEN like to be taken to my dashboard. WHERE i can see my children, and HAVE the ability to add children.

I WOULD also like to have a navbar that would give me EASY access to the relevant pages, such as my requesting absences for my child, checking their STATUS. Adding medical information and having the ability to receive and RESPOND to incident reports.

As a TEACHER upon logging in i WOULD like to be navigated to MY classroom to see all my students. I WOULD like to have ACCESS to my students information for Medical and information purposes.

I would like to CELEBRATE achievements of my students, and share these milestones with their parents.

As a teacher i WOULD want the ability to notify teh parents of an incident report and receive confirmation from the parent that the message was understood.


As a SCHOOL i would like to have an audit trail of all conversations between parents and teachers, to protect both parties and teh school. We would also like to stream line our administration processes by giving the parent the ability to request absence for their child, and respond to them via the portal, this also protects the school via documenting leave for reporting purposes.

#### React:

React.js is a popular JavaScript library that is used to create graphical interfaces of web applications. Often used to create Single Page Applications, but it can also be the basis of mobile applications. Now, React.js is the most popular front-end JavaScript library for web development.

Notable features of React include components, which are are autonomous, reusable bits of code. They are used for the same use as JavaScript functions, but run in isolation and return HTML. React allows you to define components as classes or functions through properly implemented methods and inheritance. Each component has several lifecycle methods that you can override so that your code runs at a specific time in your program.
